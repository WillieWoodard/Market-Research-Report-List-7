<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fodder Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Heat Exchange</li><li>Indirect Heat Exchange</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fodder dryer market includes two primary types: direct heat exchange and indirect heat exchange. Direct heat exchange dryers utilize hot air or gas that directly contacts the fodder, facilitating rapid moisture removal. This method is efficient but may risk quality loss if overheating occurs. In contrast, indirect heat exchange dryers transfer heat through a surface, preventing direct contact with the fodder, thus preserving quality but often requiring longer drying times. Both methods cater to diverse agricultural needs.</p></p>
