<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Curtain Wall Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unitized</li><li>Semi-unitized</li><li>Stick</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The curtain wall market comprises three main types: unitized, semi-unitized, and stick systems. Unitized systems are pre-fabricated in a factory, allowing for quick on-site assembly, enhancing efficiency. Semi-unitized systems combine factory fabrication with some on-site assembly, offering a balance between speed and customization. Stick systems involve on-site assembly of individual components, providing high design flexibility but requiring more labor and time. Each type caters to different project needs, budget constraints, and architectural preferences.</p></p>
