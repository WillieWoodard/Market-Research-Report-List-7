<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wireless X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wireless X-Ray Flat Panel Detector market is primarily segmented into two types: direct conversion and indirect conversion detectors. Direct conversion detectors use a form of photoconductive material that converts X-ray photons directly into electrical signals, offering high resolution and sensitivity. In contrast, indirect conversion detectors utilize a two-step process, first converting X-rays into light and then into electrical signals, which typically results in lower production costs but may compromise resolution. Both types cater to diverse applications in medical imaging and industrial inspection.</p></p>
