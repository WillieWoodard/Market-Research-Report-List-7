<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Protection Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cementitious Coatings</li><li>Intumescent Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire protection coatings market is primarily divided into two types: cementitious coatings and intumescent coatings. Cementitious coatings consist of a mixture of water, cement, and other additives, providing durable, fire-resistant barriers ideal for structural elements. Intumescent coatings, on the other hand, expand when exposed to heat, forming a protective char layer that insulates and shields the substrate from flames. Both types serve a critical role in enhancing fire safety in buildings and infrastructure.</p></p>
