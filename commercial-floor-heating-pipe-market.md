<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Floor Heating Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxygen Barrier Tube</li><li>Non-Oxygen Barrier Tube</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial floor heating pipe market includes two main types: oxygen barrier tubes and non-oxygen barrier tubes. Oxygen barrier tubes prevent oxygen diffusion, protecting the heating system from corrosion and extending its lifespan, making them ideal for water-based heating applications. Non-oxygen barrier tubes, while typically less expensive, do not offer this protection and are often used in specific situations where corrosion is not a significant concern. Both types serve crucial roles in enhancing energy efficiency and comfort in commercial spaces.</p></p>
