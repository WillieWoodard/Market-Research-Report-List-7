<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Inhalers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Powder Inhaler</li><li>Metered Dose Inhaler</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The respiratory inhalers market primarily includes three types: Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs), Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs), and others. DPIs deliver medication in powdered form, requiring patients to inhale forcefully to activate the device. MDIs dispense a fixed dose of medication as an aerosol spray, relying on a metered valve for delivery. Other inhalers may encompass nebulizers and soft mist inhalers, offering alternative methods for drug administration. These devices are crucial for managing respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD.</p></p>
