<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dural Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Dural (Spinal) Membrane Patch</li><li>Non-absorbable Dural (Spinal) Membrane Patch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dural patch market is segmented into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable dural patches are designed to be gradually absorbed by the body, promoting healing while eliminating the need for surgical removal, making them ideal for post-surgery applications. Non-absorbable dural patches, on the other hand, provide long-lasting support and protection to the dura mater but remain in the body indefinitely. Both types are crucial in neurosurgical procedures, enhancing recovery and reducing complications associated with dural repair.</p></p>
